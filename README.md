# Social Buzz Job Simulation - Content Trend Analysis

## Overview
This project was part of a data analytics job simulation, where I analyzed content trends and engagement for a hypothetical social media client, Social Buzz. The objective was to extract insights and make strategic recommendations for content optimization and user engagement.

## Objectives
- Conduct data cleaning and modeling on multiple datasets.
- Identify the top 5 content categories by popularity.
- Provide recommendations for maximizing user engagement based on data-driven insights.

## Datasets
The project involved seven datasets, containing information on:
1. **User interactions** - Types of reactions and timestamps.
2. **Content metadata** - Categories, types, and unique IDs.
3. **Reaction scores** - Sentiment scores associated with reaction types.

## Process
1. **Data Cleaning**: Removed duplicates and missing values to ensure data quality.
2. **Data Modeling**: Merged datasets to create a unified dataset for analysis.
3. **Data Analysis**: Identified top content categories, most common reactions, and trends in user engagement.
4. **Visualization**: Created visualizations to communicate findings effectively.

## Key Insights
- The top 5 content categories were: [Category 1], [Category 2], [Category 3], etc.
- [Insight on Reaction Type]: Example - “Photos received the most positive reactions.”
- [Insight on Posting Trends]: Example - “March had the highest volume of posts, suggesting a seasonal trend.”

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python** for data manipulation and analysis
- **SQL** for data extraction and merging
- **Excel** for quick data checks and calculations
- **PowerPoint** for presenting findings to stakeholders

## Deliverables
- **Data Cleaning Scripts**: Python scripts used to clean and preprocess the datasets.
- **Analysis and Visualizations**: Jupyter Notebooks with the analysis code and visualizations.
- **Presentation**: PowerPoint slides summarizing key insights and recommendations.

## Recommendations
1. **Content Focus**: Increase the volume of posts in the top-performing categories to drive user engagement.
2. **Posting Strategy**: Capitalize on high-activity months to boost content reach.
3. **User Interaction**: Explore further engagement options around high-interest reaction types.
